title: Supersonic Level 1 Rocket
summary: |
  One day in a friends garage, we designed and built a supersonic rocket from scratch, reaching Mach 1.5 and over 6,000 feet on an H550 ST motor. 
  
  The project emphasized cost-effective performance while ensuring structural integrity. 
  
  I performed a fiberglass layup for reinforcement and 3D-printed the nose cone, optimizing aerodynamics and durability.
