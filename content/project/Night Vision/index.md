title: SeaPerch Underwater Robot Competition
summary: |
  Built a modular digital night vision monocular as a solo project to gain experience with soldering and explore whether a professional PVS-14 would be worth the investment.

  3D printed the shell, bridge, and mount in house to keep the budget for the project to a minimum.
  3D printed a rugged housing using high-temperature materials like ABS to hold a drone camera and a small eye-mounted display, which were repurposed from off-the-shelf components.

  Rewired the drone camera and display modules to share video and power signals using a custom harness, powered by a 5V battery bank with an integrated on/off switch.

  Resolved misdocumented wiring by using a multimeter to test pinouts and rewire connections. 
  Ensured proper electrical contact between bridge and tube power terminals and components.

  Tested functionality at each step of the build to quickly identify and fix issues, resulting in a fully working prototype that has inspired further electronics and optics projects.
