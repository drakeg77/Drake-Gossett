title: Whipper Trebuchet
summary: |
  Designed, built, and tested a “Whipper Trebuchet” for a high school physics project with the goal of launching a tennis ball as far as possible.

  Modeled the trebuchet by sketching on paper and moving to Fusion 360 to complete a 3D model to present in class.

  Learned woodworking skills to cut and assemble the A-frames necessary to hold the arm.

  Streamlined the project after initial testing by increasing structural strength and researching better projectiles to increase the throw distance by 70%.
